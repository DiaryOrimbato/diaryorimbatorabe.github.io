I am Diary, MSc student in ecology and forest management at the University of Québec in Abitibi-Témiscamingue. Originally from Madagascar, I find myself involved in a researche project about the influences of mine tailing restoration on mining footprint, under the supervision of Pr [Nicole Fenton](https://forets-froides.org/annuaire/nicole-fenton/). 
My main research interest focus on landscape restoration, forest management and biodiversity conservation.
